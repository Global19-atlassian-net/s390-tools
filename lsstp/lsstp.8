.SH NAME
.B "lsstp "
\- tool to show STP system information
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BI "lsstp "

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B lsstp
displays information about the currenta Server Time Protocol (STP) configuration
like Coordianted Timing Network (CTN) ID, Timing state and Leap seconds.
.SH OUTPUT
.TP
.B STP online
Whether the STP subsystem is online
.TP
.B CTN ID
The ID of the Coordinated Time Network. If it can be decoded as EBCDIC it will be shown as EBCDIC String, otherwise a hexadecimal representation is shown.
.TP
.B CTN Type
The type of timing network.
.IP
.B No CTN
STP is not configured for attachment to a CTN.
.IP
.B STP-only
STP is configured and attached to a CTN with only STP nodes.
.IP
.B Mixed
STP is configured and attached to a CTN which contains both STP and External Time Reference (ETR) nodes.
.TP
.B Stratum
The Stratum level of the STP clock. This indicates the number of servers in the timing path between the local STP clock and the selected primary time server.
.TP
.B Timing mode
.IP
.B Local
The Time-of-day (TOD) clock is stepped to the local hardware oscillator and is not steered by the STP facility.
.IP
.B ETR
The TOD clock is synchronized with an attached 9037 Sysplex Timer.
.IP
.B STP
The TOD clock is steered by the STP facility to maintain synchronization with a Coordinated Server Time (CST).
.IP
.B Uninitialized
The TOD clock is not initialized. The STP facility is allowed to perform a step adjustment to the TOD clock for synchronization.
.TP
.B Timing state
The synchronization state of the STP facilty. Can be unsynchronzied, synchronized and stopped.
.TP
.B DST offset
The Daylight savings time offset relative to UTC in minutes.
.TP
.B Timezone offset
The offset of the local time relative to UTC in minutes.
.TP
.B Time offset
The total time offset at the server. This field is only valid in mixed CTN configurations.
.TP
.B Active Leap seconds
The number of Leap seconds that are currently in effect at the STP facility.
.TP
.B Leap second <insertion|delation> at
If a Leap second insertion or deletetion is scheduled in the STP facility, this field will show the Day and Time of the scheduled change.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI "-v|--version"
Print version number.
.TP
.BI "-h|--help"
Print usage text.
