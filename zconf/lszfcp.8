.SH NAME
lszfcp \- list information about zfcp adapters, ports, and units

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B lszfcp
.RB [ \-hvVaZHDPem ]
.RB [ \-b
.IR busid ]
.RB [ \-l
.IR lun ]
.RB [ \-p
.IR wwpn ]
.RB [ \-s
.IR /path/to/sys ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B lszfcp
provides information contained in sysfs about zfcp adapters, ports and
units and its associated scsi_hosts, fc_hosts, fc_remote_ports and
scsi_devices.

The default is to list busids of all zfcp adapters and their corresponding
SCSI host names.

There are four output variants. Default (without options "-a" or
"-V" or "-Z") is one line for each object.
For the zfcp device driver (module), its parameters are listed.
For adapters the busid and their
corresponding SCSI host names are listed.  For ports the pair
"busid"/"wwpn" and their corresponding FC-remote-port names are listed.
For units the triple "busid"/"wwpn"/"lun" and their corresponding SCSI
device names are listed.

Option "-V" additionally shows the sysfs paths of interest for the
listed object.
If a SCSI device has an associated block device (disk)
and SCSI generic (sg) device, show their sysfs paths in a 3rd line.

Option "-a" additionally shows attributes of interest found in
sysfs for the listed object.

Option "-m"  together with option "-a" shows sysfs attributes if available for:
host: css (subchannel); port: zfcp_port; lun: zfcp_unit.
Specifying option "-m" twice together with option "-a"
additionally shows SCSI device sysfs attributes
if available for:
scsi_disk, block, block_integrity, block_queue, block_queue_iosched.

Option "-e" enables an extended output format.
It enumerates all hosts/ports/luns independent of their state.
It also produces some improved error messages.
The extended output format can help determining problems.
Since a long time, without option "-e", lszfcp has
.I
not
enumerated:
hosts that have never been online (since last bind to zfcp device driver),
hosts that are defunct (CHPID configured off, or z/VM detach),
ports with fc_rport port_state unequal to "Online" (such as fibres pulled),
zfcp units without associated SCSI device (unit_add of non-existent LUN).

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B -a, --attributes
Show the most interesting attributes of the specified objects.
.TP
.B -m, --moreattrs
Show more attributes of the specified objects.
Host: css (subchannel). Port: zfcp_port. Lun: zfcp_unit.
If specified twice,
show additional attributes of the specified SCSI device objects:
scsi_disk, block, block_integrity, block_queue, block_queue_iosched.
.TP
.B -Z, --modparms
List zfcp (module) parameters with a scope of the device driver.
.TP
.B -D, --devices
List zfcp units and  SCSI devices.
.TP
.B -H, --hosts
List zfcp adapters, fc-hosts, and scsi-hosts (default).
Without option "-e", information is given only
for adapters that are online (registered at the SCSI stack).
.TP
.B -P, --ports
List zfcp ports and FC remote ports.
.TP
.B -b busid, --busid busid
Show zfcp adapter, fc-host selected by busid.
.TP
.B -l lun, --lun lun
List zfcp unit(s) and SCSI device(s) selected by lun. (Information for
several units might be shown if devices with equivalent LUNs are
configured for different adapters or ports.)
.TP
.B -p wwpn, --wwpn wwpn
List zfcp port(s) and FC remote port(s) selected by wwpn. (Information
for several ports might be shown if a remote port is configured for
different adapters.)
.TP
.B -e, --extended
Generate extended output.
.TP
.B -V, --verbose
Generate verbose output. Display sysfs path names of class and bus
devices that are of interest for this object.
If a SCSI device has an associated block device (disk)
and SCSI generic (sg) device, show their sysfs paths in a 3rd line.
.TP
.B -s, --sysfs /path/to/sys
Use path as sysfs (for dbginfo archives).
.TP
.B -h, --help
Print help message and exit.
.TP
.B -v, --version
Display version info and exit.

.SH NOTE
.PP
Options "-b", "-p" or "-l" are of restricting nature. They limit the output
to those adapters, ports or units that match the specified busid, wwpn and lun.
If none of the options "-Z", "-H", "-P" and "-D" are specified, "-b" implies "-H",
"-p" implies "-P" and "-l" implies "-D".

.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
.IP "lszfcp -P -H -D -V"
Show all device paths of all zfcp adapters, ports, units and its
associated SCSI devices, SCSI hosts, FC hosts and FC remote ports
.PP
.IP "lszfcp -b 0.0.0815 -a"
Show all attributes of ccw_device, scsi_host and fc_host which belong
to the adapter with busid "0.0.0815".
.IP "lszfcp -D -b 0.0.0815 -p 0x5005123456789000 -l 0x0000000000000000"
Show the device which matches the given busid, wwpn and lun.
.IP "lszfcp -b 0.0.0815 -p 0x5005123456789000 -l 0x0000000000000000"
Show all adapters that match the given busid, all ports that match the given
busid and wwpnn and show all units that match the given busid, wwpn and lun.
.IP "lszfcp -b 0.0.0815 -p 0x5005123456789000 -l 0x0000000000000000 -H -P -D"
Generates same output as previous example.
.IP "lszfcp -ZHPDVeamm"
Generates the fullest output in the extended format.
